So long and thanks for all the {animal_plural}
So {emotion} that it should come to this
We tried to warn you all but oh dear?
You may not share our {character_trait}
Which might explain your disrespect
For all the {adjective} wonders that
grow around you
So long, so long and thanks
for all the {animal_plural}
